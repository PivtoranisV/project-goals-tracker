# Goal Tracker App

**This project was inspired by my own personal goal tracking needs**
The application is designed to help users track their progress towards their goals and provide motivation to achieve them within the given deadline.

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter a title and deadline for your goal, and click "Add Goal". The goal will be added to the list of goals, and the remaining time will be displayed next to it.

As time passes, the remaining time will be automatically updated, and the goal will be moved to the "Achieved Goals" section once the deadline has passed and the goal has been achieved. If the deadline passes and the goal has not been achieved, it will be moved to the "Failed Goals" section.

You can click on a goal in the "Goal List" section to mark it as achieved. This will move the goal to the "Achieved Goals" section and update the remaining time for the other goals.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, simply clone the repository and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
`npm install`
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:
`npm start`

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
